# Description
 
In 2023, ElasticSearch held multiple technical conferences focused on AI and search engine integration. The core concept of this project is to combine the capabilities of search engines with generative AI (RAG technology) to provide powerful intelligent dish search and recommendation services. Offering various interactive methods, our system allows global customers to express their needs effortlessly through speech-to-text technology or interact with the system in a chat-like interface similar to WeChat. Leveraging the strengths of generative AI, our system can analyze the userâ€™s mood, physical condition, taste preferences, and personal interests to recommend vegetables, meats, and dishes from our restaurant that best suit their needs.
